## Concept Arts already posted and still waiting to be posted

Check the sheet to see what already has been posted on the subreddit

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14p0FeMfD9lXcY5rqVcpNuzXk9eDwNvnAwy6302RKnH4/edit?pli=1&gid=2444970#gid=2444970

I made a github:

https://github.com/laaners/yugioh_concept_arts/tree/main

to see what's missing, gathered in yhe [concept_arts.json](concept_arts.json). The json only contains concept arts that have yet to be published or have to be re-published on the subreddit. Concept arts are divided by the series:
- `"DM"`
- `"DSOD"`
- `"GX"`
- `"5D's"`
- `"Zexal"`
- `"Arc-V"`
- `"VRAINS"`
- `"SEVENS"`
- `"season0"`

No Go Rush since all of the concept arts are on twitter and have been already published on the subreddit. Each series has then:

- `"characters"`, identified by their both the sub and the dub full name and surname, for example "Mai Valentine/Kujaku", "Rex Raptor/Dinosaur Ryuzaki"
    - A partical identifier "cast" refers to reference arts depicting multiple characters, sort of height comparison
- `"cards"`, identified by their full TCG name, for example "T.G. Halberd Cannon", "Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon"
- `"props"`, unsure if to keep this or not, need help with identifying the locations
- `"locations"`, unsure if to keep this or not 

## Sources
Here I list the sources I'm looking into. Symbols explanation:

- [✔️|✔️] means that all the concept arts from that source are posted on the subreddit in a single post or in separated posts
- [❌|✔️] means that NOT ALL the concept arts from that source are posted on the subreddit BUT they are included in the [json](concept_arts.json)
- [❌,❌] means that NOT ALL the concept arts from that source are posted on the subreddit AND NOT ALL are included in the [json](concept_arts.json)
- ♾️ means that the source is being updated continuously, making so something that has to be checked periodically as new concept arts may appear

## Posting
Here are some guidelines you should follow before you post on the [subreddit](https://new.reddit.com/r/yugiohconceptart/):
- Check if a post on the subreddit already exists and immediately after you post update the sheet, in this way we can also avoid repetitions (do not abuse this power!)
- Try to do one post dedicated to one specific card/specific character. If you cannot find a high resolution for a certain concept art, I think it's fine if you post it anyway and update the sheet. Usually (and hopefully) the official twitters will reveal a version with better quality, when it happens we can delete the old post and make a new one
- Attach the correct post flair and if a concept is not from the "Main Card Game" put also the post flair in the title of the post, like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/yugiohconceptart/comments/136xag2/rush_duel_amabie/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
The flairs are self-explanatory, but if you are in doubt ask. I think the current available flairs should cover any kind of concept arts, if not let me know
- It's not mandatory, but when posting the concept art of a card, attaching a secondary image of the physical card is a good idea! Like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/yugiohconceptart/comments/136xag2/rush_duel_amabie/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
- Remember to always cite the source in the comments
