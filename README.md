The [json](concept_arts.json) only contains concept arts that have yet to be published or have to be re-published on the subreddit. Concept arts are divided by the series:
- "DM"
- "DSOD"
- "GX"
- "5D's"
- "Zexal"
- "Arc-V"
- "VRAINS"
- "SEVENS"
- "season0"

No Go Rush since all of the concept arts are on twitter and have been already published on the subreddit. Each series has then:

- "characters", identified by their both the sub and the dub full name and surname, for example "Mai Valentine/Kujaku", "Rex Raptor/Dinosaur Ryuzaki"
    - A partical identifier "cast" refers to reference arts depicting multiple characters, sort of height comparison
- "cards", identified by their full TCG name, for example "T.G. Halberd Cannon", "Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon"
- "props", unsure if to keep this or not, need help with identifying the locations
- "locations", unsure if to keep this or not
